jQuery Functions
Diving further into jQuery Functions. Created Buttons to Prepend/Append lists. Add <li> items before or after lists. Delete items when clicked. Change background colors. Loop through arrays to print items on the page.

This was another intro to jQuery project that we worked on during the first few weeks of class. Experimented with basic functions to change elements on the webpage. Wanted to keep the layout and format simple so we could focus on the jQuery rather than styling.
